Now, whenever you go to the cash game selection screen, you'll see a new option. This option is for the lowest buy-in table, called the 'Discount Credits Table.' Let's break down the top 3 benefits for you...</p><p class=\"opacity-70 font-12 md:font-20 text-blue line-height-1-5\">The first benefit is that if you don't have sufficient buy-in balance left, you can join this table for free! Yes, absolutely free!</p><p class=\"opacity-70 font-12 md:font-20 text-blue line-height-1-5\">The second benefit is that if you win a points, pools, or deals game on the Discount Credits Table, you earn Discount Credits! You can use these Discount Credits to get discounted buy-in on cash games. Let's understand this with an example. Say, you played a 6-player 101 Pools game on the Discount Credits Table and won. Since you did not have sufficient buy-in balance, you joined the table for free. Because you won, you earned 5.1 DC. You can use these 5.1 DC to join cash games at discounted buy in value.</p>"},{title:"Why are some games charged and some games for free?",content:'<p class="opacity-70 font-12 md:font-20 text-blue line-height-1-5">Players can play unlimited games on Discount Credits Table. Let us understand how this works. If you do not have any buy in balance available in your wallet, then you will be able to join the Discount Credits Table for free. If you win the game, you will get Discount Credits. However, if you have available buy in balance in the form of Discount Credits then the entry will not be free. Discount Credits equal to the buy in value of that game will be applied from your wallet.</p>'},{title:"Can I withdraw the winnings from free games on Discount Credits Table?",content:'<p class="opacity-70 font-12 md:font-20 text-blue line-height-1-5">No as discount credits are non monetary. Winnings from the Discount Credits Table are in the form of Discount Credits. As per the platform policy, you cannot withdraw your Discount Credits balance. When you win cash games, your Discount Credits eventually get converted to withdrawal balance.</p>'}]}]}},head:function(){return{title:"GST Policy for Online Rummy Games - RummyTime",meta:[{hid:"description",name:"description",content:"GST policy for online rummy games which also deals with real cash rummy are important and every pro rummy player should know about it."},{hid:"keywords",name:"keywords",content:"gst policy for online rummy"},{hid:"robots",name:"robots",content:"index, follow"}],link:[{hid:"canonical",rel:"canonical",href:"".concat("https://www.rummytime.com").concat(this.$route.path)}],script:[{type:"application/ld+json",json:{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BreadcrumbList",itemListElement:[{"@type":"ListItem",position:1,item:{"@id":"https://www.rummytime.com/",name:"Home"}},{"@type":"ListItem",position:2,item:{"@id":"https://www.rummytime.com/privacy-policy/",name:"Privacy Policy"}}]}}]}},computed:{isScrollingComputed:function(){return!!this.isScrolling}},mounted:function(){var e=0;(window.addEventListener("scroll",(function(){var t=window.pageYOffset||document.documentElement.scrollTop,body=document.querySelector("body");t>e?t>128&&body&&body.classList.add("body-scrolled"):t<128&&body&&body.classList.remove("body-scrolled"),e=t<=0?0:t}),!1),window.location.hash)&&(document.querySelector(window.location.hash)&&this.scrollToSection("direct-url",window.location.hash.replace("#","")));var t=new IntersectionObserver(this.handleIntersection.bind(this),{root:null,threshold:.1,rootMargin:"0px 0px -50% 0px"});this.$nextTick((function(){document.querySelectorAll(".gst-section").forEach((function(section){t.observe(section)}))}))},methods:{handleScrollEnd:function(){this.isScrolling=!1,window.removeEventListener("scroll",this.handleScroll)},handleScroll:function(){clearTimeout(this.scrollTimer),this.scrollTimer=setTimeout(this.handleScrollEnd.bind(this),200)},scrollToSection:function(e,t){var o=window.dataLayer;o&&o.push({event:"gst-click",category:"".concat(e,"-").concat(t),action:"click",label:"".concat(e,"-").concat(t,"-gst-link"),noninteraction:!1});var section=document.querySelector("#".concat(t));if(section){this.isScrolling=!0,window.location.hash="#".concat(t),this.activeSectionId=t;section.getBoundingClientRect().top;window.addEventListener("scroll",this.handleScroll)}else;},handleIntersection:function(e){var t=this;this.isScrolling||e.forEach((function(e){if(e.isIntersecting&&!t.isScrolling){var o="#".concat(e.target.id);window.location.hash!==o&&(t.activeSectionId=e.target.id,window.history.replaceState(null,null,o));var n=window.dataLayer;n&&n.push({event:"gst-click",category:"page-scroll-".concat(o),action:"scroll"})}else"introduction"!==e.target.id||!window.location.hash||"introduction"!==t.activeSectionId&&""!==t.activeSectionId||window.history.replaceState(null,null,window.location.href.split("#")[0])}))}}},c=(o(729),o(1)),component=Object(c.a)(d,(function(){var e=this,t=e._self._c;return t("div",[t("gst-nav",{attrs:{"gst-feature-list":e.linkInfoItems,"active-section-id":e.activeSectionId},on:{linkClicked:e.scrollToSection}}),e._v(" "),t("section",{staticClass:"bg-theme-background"},[t("div",{staticClass:"container-v1 container-v1--box pt-16 md:pt-40 pb-32 md:pb-40 gutter-3 md:gutter-4"},[e._m(0),e._v(" "),t("div",{staticClass:"row"},e._l(e.linkInfoItems,(function(o,n){return t("div",{key:n,staticClass:"col mt-8 md:mt-32 col--12 sm:col--6 md:col--4"},[t("gst-link-card",{attrs:{"link-info":o},on:{linkClicked:e.scrollToSection}})],1)})),0)])]),e._v(" "),e._l(e.sectionItems,(function(e,o){return t("section",{key:e.title,staticClass:"gst-section",class:{"bg-surface":o%2==0},attrs:{id:e.link}},[t("gst-section",{attrs:{"section-info":e}})],1)}))],2)}),[function(){var e=this,t=e._self._c;return t("div",{staticClass:"row"},[t("div",{staticClass:"col col--12"},[t("h1",{staticClass:"font-700 font-32 md:font-48 line-height-1-2 md:line-height-1 mb-8 md:mb-16"},[e._v("RummyTime GST Policy")]),e._v(" "),t("p",{staticClass:"font-400 font-14 md:font-20 mb-12 md:mb-0 line-height-1-5 opacity-70"},[e._v("\n            Effective from 1 October 2023, the new GST policy will be applicable for all "),t("a",{staticStyle:{color:"#51065d"},attrs:{href:"/"}},[e._v("rummy games")]),e._v(" in India.
