<div>The first benefit is that if you don&#8217;t have sufficient buy-in balance left, you can join this table for free! Yes, absolutely free!</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>The second benefit is that if you win a points, pools, or deals game on the Discount Credits Table, you earn Discount Credits! You can use these Discount Credits to get discounted buy-in on cash games. Let&#8217;s understand this with an example. Say, you played a 6-player 101 Pools game on the Discount Credits Table and won. Since you did not have sufficient buy-in balance, you joined the table for free. Because you won, you earned 5.1 DC. You can use these 5.1 DC to join games up to ₹5.</div>
